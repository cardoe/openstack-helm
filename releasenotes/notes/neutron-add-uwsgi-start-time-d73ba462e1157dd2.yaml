    Added uwsgi start-time configuration to neutron-api-uwsgi section. The
    start-time parameter is set to "%t" (unix time at instance startup) and is
    used by ML2/OVN for creating OVN hash ring registers per worker. This
    configuration is mandatory for proper ML2/OVN operation. See the Neutron
    documentation for more details:

    Added `start-time: "%t"` to the neutron_api_uwsgi configuration in
    values.yaml. This parameter provides the unix timestamp at instance startup
    and is required by ML2/OVN to create OVN hash ring registers during the
    initialization process. The value is automatically populated by uWSGI when
    the Neutron API process starts.
